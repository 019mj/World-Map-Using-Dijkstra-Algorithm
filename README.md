# World-Map-Using-Dijkstra-Algorithm

The following project is an enhanced small version of Google Maps using Dijkstra Algorithm for Educational Purposes.
To achieve this project I have used my enhanced data structures such as Heap, Hash Maps, Linked Lists and Graph.

To help creating a creative graphical user experience, Advanced Java FX techniques were applied.

All of the data in the file "countries.txt" are real data including the longitude and latitude of a country and the edges between countries.
The following are screenshots from the program:

Quick note: I think this project will be my masterpiece!
Quick note: My instructor (Iyad Jaber) said to me (شغلك مرتب مرتب مرتب ، ماشاء الله عنك والله), probably it's the first time he said something like that to a human being.
